            <h3>Welcome to world of books</h3>
            <p>Books are portasl to other worlds-the world of politicians , historians , magicians 
                , kings , queens , wolves , vampires - you name it.
            </p>
            <p>
            I never feel lonely if I've got a book - they're like old friends. 
            Even if you're not reading them over and over again, you know they are there. 
            And they're part of your history. They sort of tell a story about your journey through life. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The books that help you most are those which make you think that most. 
            The hardest way of learning is that of easy reading; 
            but a great book that comes from a great thinker is a ship of thought, 
            deep freighted with truth and beauty.
